# âœ¨ ðŸŒˆ âš¡ An Exploration into Creating Art from Databases

I gave this lightning talk at [Geekcamp Singapore 2022](https://geekcamp.sg/); a video is coming soon! View the slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1h-o2oOY9kYxrG8SrkzULx_yuDH_LpL6HxJStao52FQA/edit?usp=sharing).

> When I ask, what does a database look like? An ER Diagram may come to mind. How about, what does a DB sound like? Hmm.. maybe, the screams of one being accidentally deleted. Ultimately, art is made up of data. A song has notes, a painting has pixels etc. So, why not turn our databases into art?
